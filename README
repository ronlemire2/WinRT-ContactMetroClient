ContactMetroClient
================================================================================

Two weeks ago I installed Windows 8 Release Candidate and Visual Studio 2012 
Release Candidate. ContactMetroClient is my first Metro Style app written in
C# and XAML. I do not have a Windows 8 device yet. Since Windows 8 supports 
mouse and keyboard in addition to touch, I'm developing and testing my Metro
apps on a laptop running Windows 8.

Included are the following projects:
	1) ContactBusinessEntities - EF4 generated entities
	2) ContactDataAccess - EF4 ADO.NET Entity Data Model
	3) ContactBusinessLogic - Business Rules
	4) ContactWebService - WCF Service hosted in IIS 8
	5) ContactCloudWebService - WCF Service hosted in Windows Azure
	6) ContactWinFormsClient - Access to WCF Service in IIS8 or Windows Azure
	7) ContactMetroClient - Windows 8 Metro Style App accessing Windows Azure
	8) Data - SQL Server 2012 Contact Database backup
	9) Screenshots - from Windows Azure simulator
	
This github does not contain any Android code. It's all C#. I've submitted
a few of the projects in previous githubs but wanted to group all the latest
code in one place. The Android client still works with the latest code.

ContactMetroClient is based on these Code Project Articles:
	http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/391783/An-Address-Book-Application-Made-in-MVVM-For-Metro	(Part 1)
	http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/393037/An-Address-Book-Application-Made-in-MVVM-For-Metro	(Part 2)
Part 1 is a very good example of the MVVM pattern. It's simple and to the point. 
Part 2 implements persistence with an XML file.
I used Part 1 as the MVVM structure for ContactMetroClient but implemented 
persistence with a Windows Azure WCF Service to a SQL Azure Database.

Screenshots were captured by the Windows Azure simulator in Visual Studio 2012.
